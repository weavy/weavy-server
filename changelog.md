* Change `new WeavyClient({ ...options })` to use `new Weavy({ ...options })` or use the `useWeavy({ ...options })` hook.
* Remove `<WeavyProvider>`. May optionally be replaced with `<WyContext ...options />` in conjunction with removing `WeavyClient`.

New major release of Weavy where the backend has been ported from .NET Framework to .NET Core. 
This release only contains the Messenger app. Other apps and features will arrive in future releases.
Upgrading from previous versions of Weavy is not yet supported.


The Weavy backend code has been ported to .NET Core. We still uses some APIs that are only available on Windows but cross-platform support is in progress.

The drop-in UI has been rewritten and is published to npmjs.org for easier installation and integration.
